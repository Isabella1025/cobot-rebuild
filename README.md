# Cobot - AI-Powered Academic Collaboration Platform

An intelligent academic collaboration platform that enables service_admins to create course-specific AI bots trained on course materials, facilitating real-time student-bot-service_admin interactions.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Student:** Isabella Tsikata  
**Supervisor:** Dennis Owusu  
**Institution:** Ashesi University

Cobot addresses the gap in personalized, course-aware AI support for higher education. Unlike generic AI tools, Cobot allows service_admins to train AI bots specifically on their course content, providing students with accurate, contextual assistance 24/7.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Course-Specific AI Bots**: service_admins create and train bots on their course materials
- **Real-Time Communication**: Instant messaging powered by Socket.IO
- **Document Upload & Processing**: Support for PDF, DOCX, PPTX, and TXT files
- **Vector Store Integration**: Semantic search using OpenAI embeddings
- **Group Chat Management**: Organize discussions by course and topic
- **Voice Interaction**: Speech-to-text for audio messages (coming soon)
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate permissions for students and service_admins

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Real-Time**: Socket.IO
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4 & Embeddings API

### Frontend
- **Languages**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Styling**: Custom CSS (responsive design)
- **Real-Time**: Socket.IO Client

### Security & Tools
